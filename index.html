                       Thankfully, smart home thermostats can change your home's 
                       temperature to a pleasant setting.
                       So, even while you are asleep, you can save electricity
                       and maintain temperature.

                        how much electricity your home uses down

                        Meanwhile, the market for internet of things (IoT) products—a 
                        catchall term for connected physical devices—is expected to hit 
                        over $313 billion globally by 2027, 
                        according to ResearchAndMarkets.Com. But ongoing issues with smart home tech have 
                        likely slowed the pace of adoption.

                    <h4 class="faq_question">
                        I heard that smart home devices have an interoperability problem, is that so?
                    </h4>

                    <p class="faq_answer">
                        In an ideal world, a consumer could buy a smart device, boot it up,
                        and have it work seamlessly with other devices in the house.
                        Unfortunately, that’s often not the case with today’s products, 
                        due to a lack of standardization in the industry.
                        Devices today use a variety of different network protocols, such as wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, 
                        and Z-wave, which means they cannot all connect or communicate with each other.<br>
                        Adopting a new device might require downloading a new app for its control, creating a digitized 
                        version of the “too many remotes” dilemma.
                        However, the problem is being addressed. Some of the leading companies in the market, 
                        including Amazon, Apple, and Google, launched a standard communication protocol called 
                        Matter in 2019 that aims to become the industry’s new wireless standard.<br>

                        Adoption of the new standard is set to take off, according to ABI Research, a tech market research firm.
                        It projected in 2022 that in the next five years, 
                        half of the world’s “key” smart devices would be compatible with Matter.

                    <h4 class="faq_question">
                        Smart home devices are vulnerable to Cyber Attacks, is that true?
                    </h4>

                    <p class="faq_answer">
                        Hypothetically, anyone anywhere in the world with an internet connection
                        could hack into a home by exploiting
                        a vulnerability in its software. According to a report by the Czech security
                        company Avast, nearly 41% (pdf)
                        of smart homes have at least one potentially hackable device that could put the
                        entire home at risk.<br><br>

                        Poor security begins at the manufacturing stage. Many devices do not 
                        encrypt data, leaving information 
                        ripe for the picking by third parties. Devices may also lack or rarely have software updates, 
                        meaning both their design and security can quickly become obsolete. 
                        Another issue is the frequent lack of strong passwords, or use of the factory’s 
                        default passwords.<br><br>
                    
                        In 2016, a massive cyberattack on the eastern seaboard of the US demonstrated 
                        how smart devices not only 
                        endanger individual households, but also broader networks. 
                        Hackers used insecure devices in homes,
                        like routers and baby monitors, to generate a botnet—a bunch of malware-infected
                        personal computers—that
                        took down entire websites including Twitter, Reddit, and CNN.com.

                        Your smart devices are probably spying on us?
                    </h4>

                    <p class="faq_answer">
                        Smart devices collect personal data, not only because it may
                        be required for it to perform functions, 
                        but also because data is a recurring source of value to companies. 
                        Tech giants Google and Meta may deny that they “sell” data to third parties,
                        but that doesn’t mean they aren’t sharing your information to competing advertisers
                        bidding for ad placements.<br><br>

                        A 2019 study (pdf) conducted by Imperial College London and Northeastern University
                        examined the privacy of 
                        81 different IoT devices. It found, after carrying out over 34,500 controlled 
                        experiments, that most of those devices, 
                        including smart speakers, TVs, and appliances, collected and shared personal information
                        with a third party.
                    
                        Imagine you ask your voice assistant, Alexa, to find a place to eat pizza in your neighborhood.
                        That information could be recorded and sent to a central server owned by Amazon.<br><br>
                        In turn, that information may be shown to advertisers looking to target their next customers. 
                        In short, a home filled with smart devices also becomes a site for companies to farm monetizable data,
                        further blurring the line between privacy and private enterprise.

                        There’s no way to take ownership of your personal data?
                    </h4>

                    <p class="faq_answer">
                        Even if a consumer is comfortable with sharing data, 
                        they’re still giving it away for free.
                        Currently, there is no way for consumers to monetize personal data,
                        though there are proposed solutions.<br><br>

                        One business model, called “sensing as a service” (S2aaS), 
                        has been discussed in academic circles (pdf)
                        as a way to compensate people for their information. 
                        The idea is that data consumers (i.e. tech companies)
                        would pay data producers (i.e. smart device users) for the information they generate.

                    Sometimes Smart home devices can be glitchy, unreliable, and unnecessary?
                </h4>

                <p class="faq_answer">
                    A lot of smart home devices are low-tech products with a high-tech veneer,
                    such as the 
                    smart hairbrush that can identify frizziness, the smart egg tray that tracks expiration dates,
                    and $100 smart toaster that will send you push notifications exist.<br><br>

                    If the internet goes down, smart houses can also become even “dumber” than a gadget-free house:
                    Lights will no longer turn on, you might not be able to change the thermostat, or even unable to 
                    turn on or off your home security alarm—an incident that wreaked havoc in UK homes in 2018.<br><br>

                    Even when everything should be working right, people with so-called smart homes have reported weird phenomena,
                    like Alexa emitting creepy laughter and smart sink faucets triggered by certain radio frequencies. 
                    One Massachusetts homeowner couldn’t shut off his/her 7,000 smart lights for over a year due to a software issue.
